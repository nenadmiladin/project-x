# Infrastructure Deploy:
:rocket:

As a showcase, 3 different ways for Infrastructure deployment were used: scripts, Ansible yaml files and Terraform files.

It is not best practice and was utilized just as a demonstration of my skills.

The infrastructure consists of 2 VMs (Jenkins-Master, Jenkins-Slave )and one Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS).

The free Azure account is limited to 4 vCPUs, while AKS needs to be run on at least 2 vCPUs.

Jenkins-Master VM was deployed utilizing the script: project-x/scripts/jenkins-master.sh and was configured with project-x/scripts/config-jenkins.sh

Jenkins-Slave VM was deployed utilizing ansible: project-x/ansible/Jenkins-Slave.yaml

AKS cluster was deployed with a Terraform files: project-x/terraform/main.tf and project-x/terraform/variables.tf
Another option which was written out is to utilize a script: project-x/scripts/cluster.sh
