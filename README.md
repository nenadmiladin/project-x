# Infrastructure Deploy:
:rocket:

As a showcase, 3 different ways for Infrastructure deployment were used: scripts, Ansible yaml files and Terraform files.

It is not best practice and was utilized just as a demonstration of my skills.

The infrastructure consists of 2 VMs (Jenkins-Master, Jenkins-Slave )and one Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS).

The free Azure account is limited to 4 vCPUs, while AKS needs to be run on at least 2 vCPUs.
